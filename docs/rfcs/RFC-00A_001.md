# RFC-00A_001 — Amendment: RFC-00 Manifest Initial Adjustment

## Context
During the initial landing of RFC-00 into the repository, `docs/rfcs/RFC-00_MANIFEST.md` required alignment edits to match the enforcement rules and templates added in the same PR.

## Change
- Minor edits to `docs/rfcs/RFC-00_MANIFEST.md` performed as part of RFC-00 initialization.

## Impact
- No runtime/product behavior impact (docs/governance only).
- Governance consistency improvement.

## Risk
- Low. Documentation-only change.

## Mitigation
- Protected by CODEOWNERS + CI enforcement.
